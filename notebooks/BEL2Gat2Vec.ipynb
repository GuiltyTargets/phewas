Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3beta and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau.', 'citation': {'type': 'PubMed', 'reference': '23362255'}, 'annotations': {'Confidence': {'High': True}, 'Subgraph': {'Tau protein subgraph': True}}}\n",

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABeta¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABeta¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃƒÅ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃƒÅ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].', 'citation': {'type': 'PubMed', 'reference': '20847424'}, 'annotations': {'Confidence': {'High': True}, 'Subgraph': {'GSK3 subgraph': True, 'Tau protein subgraph': True}}, 'subject': {'modifier': 'Activity'}}\n",

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABeta¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABeta¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃƒÅ¸ [97].

Thus, it is concluded that alpha-SN functions as a connecting mediator for tau and GSK-3beta, resulting in GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Because the expression of alpha-SN is promoted by oxidative stress, the accumulation of alpha-SN induced by such stress may directly induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta. Furthermore, we found that heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) suppresses the alpha-SN-induced phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta through its direct binding to alpha-SN, suggesting that Hsp70 acts as a physiological suppressor of alpha-SN-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation.', 'citation': {'type': 'PubMed', 'reference': '21985244'}, 'annotations': {'Confidence': {'High': True}, 'Subgraph': {'GSK3 subgraph': True, 'Tau protein subgraph': True, 'Synuclein subgraph': True}}, 'object': {'modifier': 'Activity'}}\n",
